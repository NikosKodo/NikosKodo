### Hi there 👋, my name is Nikolaos Kontogiorgis

Aspiring Engineer with experience in data and cloud engineering, software testing and development. I enjoy 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐠𝐬𝐢𝐝𝐞 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐬 to help organizations enhance system reliability and implement scalable solutions for 𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐮𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧.

𝐌𝐲 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬

In my Thesis, I achieved 𝟗𝟕.𝟔𝟑% 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐲 𝐢𝐧 𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐟𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐬 (EEG signals) for human emotion recognition by developing a deep learning-based 𝟑𝐃 𝐂𝐍𝐍 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐚 𝐝𝐮𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐦𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐬𝐦, effectively extracting temporal and spatial features.
Additionally, developed a 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐢𝐩𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐞 𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞-𝐬𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐞 𝐄𝐄𝐆 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐭𝐬, improving training efficiency by 25% through optimized storage and efficient retrieval for my deep learning model. Applied 𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗼𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 and 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 techniques in MATLAB to ensure high-quality input for model training.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐭𝐡𝐬:

Thrilled about opportunities and challenges that allow me to apply my experience in SQL, Python, Cloud Computing, Big Data Processing and Machine Learning while leveraging my expertise in scalable ETL Pipelines, Data Warehousing, Cloud Services and Deep Learning techniques.

𝐎𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐬:

My interests range from Distributed Systems, Big Data, Intelligent systems and Cognitive computing. I'm always excited to explore new innovations and technologies.

Beyond technology, I enjoy playing team sports ⚽ where I collaborate with others for a common goal, as well as reading books 📚 and listening to podcasts 🎙️ to expand my knowledge and perspective.

I am motivated to put my academic knowledge into practice. If my journey interests you or you’d like to connect, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn! 📩 You can also contact me at nikoskodogiorg@gmail.com.
