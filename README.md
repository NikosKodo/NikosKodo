<!--
**NikosKodo/NikosKodo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🎓 I’m currently studying Computer Science & Engineering @ University of Patras
- 🎨 I prefer working in Machine Learning projects
- ⚡ I like to exercise, play team sports and learn new things about my field computer science
